<p id="about">
Happy Father's Day Daddy, I did this HTML page last minute. Me and Mummy planned to surprise you with
this Webpage. If me and mummy were in Singapore now, we would have had so much fun, well next year when 
we come there we will go to Timezone and eat outside and have fun. Hope you like it this webpage!

You are the best Dad anyone can ask for. You work very hard just to earn for our family and my future,
you always said funny jokes that made me and mummy laugh till our stomach burst. When we were in 
Singapore you always take me to different restaurants where the food is delicious to eat when we go 
out to fun places. You always tell me to do Udemy but I don't not know how the it is going to help me 
in the future, but I do know that I will understan when I grow up.
